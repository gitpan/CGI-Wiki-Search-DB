NAME
    CGI::Wiki::Search::DB - use the DB to search for wiki pages

SYNOPSIS
      my $store = $wiki->store;
      my $search = CGI::Wiki::Search::DB->new( store => $store );
      my %wombat_nodes = $search->search_nodes("wombat");

    Provides search-related methods for CGI::Wiki.

    See also CGI::Wiki::Search::Base, for methods not documented here.

    Searches very simply, using the database's own text-searching ability.
    Doesn't do fuzzy matching, doesn't do phrases, doesn't depend on a whole
    host of other modules.

METHODS
    new
          my $search = CGI::Wiki::Search::DB->new( store => $store );

        Takes only one parameter, which is mandatory. "store" is the
        CGI::Wiki store object that you want to search.
